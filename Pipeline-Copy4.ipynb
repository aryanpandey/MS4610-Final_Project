    "\n",
    "- Auto Loans: Loans where Vehicles are kept as collateral\n",
    "- Revolving Credit: You have a fixed amount that you can borrow in some fixed time frame. After that the amount you can borrow replenishes to the full amount. Although you will have a maximum limit. For example, you can borrow 100 rupees a month max and the overall limit on that credit line is 500 rupees. So if your overall borrowed amount is 460 rupees and for that month you havenn't borrowed anything so far, you will be able to borrow only 40 rupees even though the monthly limit is 100\n",

    "### Feature Ideas and Experiments\n",
    "- Binary Variable for checking if the person has moved into current residence after issuing any credit lines\n",
    "- Credit Amount Paid / Number of Credit Lines with No Missed Payments\n",
    "- Max Cred Available vs Default Severity\n",
    "- Separate modeling for 0 Default Severity vs Non-Zero Default Severity\n",
    "- KNN Missing Values Fill In\n",
    "- Property Value vs Annual Income (Some Indicator of whether or not a person spends too much for their Income)\n",
